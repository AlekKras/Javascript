This is basically a repo for most of my Javascript programs and history of how I got to learn couple of frameworks. 
I am confident that by the time you are reading this, it's all outdated, because the web-development world is crazy fast. 
However, I learnt all that within couple months which, hopefully, proves to you that I have an essential skill for most
of programmers - skill how to learn new things fast :)
