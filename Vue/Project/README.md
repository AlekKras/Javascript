&emsp;This is a simple Vue js app which uses <a href="https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js">typed js</a> as well.<br/>
Those words that turn into emojis - it works only once. 
If you want to make it work as many times as you want, 
try using <code>v-repeat</code>, <code>v-for</code> or anything else.
Apart from that, it's a pretty easy to follow if 
you just started learning Vue.js<br/>
