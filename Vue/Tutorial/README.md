<b> What is it? </b><br/>
Tutorials which are basically part of code which you can read and play around in your browser. <br/>

There a <strong>lot</strong> of comments here. It's hard to get stuck.<br/>
<b>Are there any useful links to learn VUE?</b><br/>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/5-free-vuejs-tutorials-3caa8ff865e9#.9k9oikd0k">Perfect one if you like video tutorials</a></li>
</ul>
<b>What if I want to learn by watching others code?</b><br/>
That's nice. Here are some useful links for you:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://trank.com.ua/course/udemy-vuejs-2">Pretty nice because it has 300 videos ðŸ˜ƒ</a></li>

</ul>
<h6><i>Sometimes, I get bored and do some css stuff in those lessons which are pretty easy-to-follow</i></h6><br/>
